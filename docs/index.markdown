_apizy_ - a robust node.js library designed for seamless communication with a frontend app.

Designed with typescript in mind. 

---

Letâ€™s break down the responsibilities:

- **You**:
    - Define your API methods and types on the backend.
- **apizy**:
    - Validates input/output structures during server compilation (when using TypeScript).
    - Checks input/output structures at runtime.
    - Exposes an HTTP API.
    - Provides a development page with detailed API documentation and a playground.
    - Generates a ready-to-use JavaScript SDK with highly typed TypeScript definitions, giving you all the API data structures on the frontend out of the box.
